# Deploy on our Private/some-server

- According to our process cycle at this step we pull our Image from amazon ECR on our development server so it can run the container in server.

## To start the container on our Development server

- we must have all the containers that our application need in our case it's mongodb and mongo-express

- create a `docker compose` as old tutorial create the `.yaml` and configure the values as needed!

- add a key-value pair inside services

```yaml
my-app:
  image: ${docker-registry}/my-app:1.0
  ports:
    - 3000:3000
```

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  # my-app:
  # image: ${docker-registry}/my-app:1.0
  # ports:
  # - 3000:3000
  mongodb:
    image: mongo
    ports:
      - 27017:27017
    environment:
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin
      - MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password
    volumes:
      - mongo-data:/data/db
  mongo-express:
    image: mongo-express
    restart: always # fixes MongoNetworkError when mongodb is not ready when mongo-express starts
    ports:
      - 8080:8081
    environment:
      - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME=admin
      - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD=password
      - ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER=mongodb
volumes:
  mongo-data:
    driver: local
```

**_The above Docker-Compose file will be used on the development sever to deploy all the applications/services_**

## Now pull and Run in Dev server!

- _To simulate a dev server for our example use new instance of our terminal and follow the old pulling process of an image and running a container the oly new thing is we have to pull it from amazon ECR this time_
