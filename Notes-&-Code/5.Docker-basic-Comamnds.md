# Docker Commands

### **1. How to Pull Applications!/Image**

SYNTAX:-

```
    docker pull <Application-name>:<Version>
```

Example:

```
    1. docker pull redis:4.0
    2. If the is version not specified then,
        docker pull redis
        will actually looks like in back as
        docker pull redis:latest
```

---

### **2. How to Run the Application!**

SYNTAX:-

```
    docker run <Application>:<Version>
```

Example:

```
    1. If the image is locally available then docker run will directly executes the application!

    - docker run redis:latest

    2. If the image is locally not available then docker run will pull the Image from dockerHub and then start the application

    - docker run redis
    (pull + start) = Combination of!

    3. Point to note docker run and docker start are different commands which will be discussed later on!
```

**`docker run options`**

```
    docker run -d (detach the terminal and use the same terminal to run commands normally if we don't use -d then it will start the container on same terminal and we won't be able to use that terminal normally  )
    docker run -p -(binds the given port between host and container)
```

### **3. How to Start and Stop a container**

SYNTAX:-

```
    docker start
    docker stop
```

- We can use the "start" and "stop" commands with a "postfix" of "container name" or "container id" to start or stop specific containers. The container id can be obtained using the inf command "docker ps"

---

### **4. Difference between start and run command**

- When you use `docker run application-Name>` it creates a new container with a new ID, port, and so on. Conversely, `docker start application-name>` will restart the previous available container only if it is still available.

---

### **5. See running docker containers details**

1. SYNTAX:-Will lists all the running containers

```
    docker ps
```

options

```
    docker ps -a (will lists all the details of container weather they are running or not!)
```

2. To see all the Images available locally on your device!
   SYNTAX

```
    docker image
```

### **6.How to delete Image and Containers**

     **DELETE CONTAINER**

    SYNTAX
    ```
        docker rm [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [CONTAINER...]
    ```
    **DELETE IMAGE**

     SYNTAX
    ```
        docker rmi [OPTIONS] IMAGE [IMAGE...]
        or
        docker image rm [OPTIONS] IMAGE [IMAGE...]
    ```

---

### **7.How to Build and Image**

```
    command : docker build [OPTIONS] PATH | URL | -
    eg:docker build -t my-app:1.0 .
```

---

### **7.How to Compose Container**

**Docker Compose commands**

```
    docker-compose -f <configured-file.yaml> up
    docker-compose -f <configured-file.yaml> down

    (here f is for file)
```

---

### **8.How to get the terminal of running container**

- What do you mean by this? We simply believe it means that each container has its own directory, and that we can use this command to check the log file or navigate between the directories of that running container to access the container terminal.

```
    docker exec -it "<container-Id> || <application-name:version>" /bin/bash
    (it = interactive terminal)
```

after this we will be change to root user for that running container!

Point to Note: IT has limited commands to execute only eg. curl is NA...

- To exit out use `exit`!
